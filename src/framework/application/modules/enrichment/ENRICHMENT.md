# Enrichment Modules
## Enhancing the data you have already through a variety of methods.


as simple as it sounds, enrichment is the process of enhancing the data you already have. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as:
- crack password hashes to obtain access to user accounts
- reference current operation against quality data sources to compare and contrast
- reverse engineer malware to understand its behavior
- extract metadata from files to understand their contents
- etc.


Examples of how I am looking to implement this:

# GitHub Inspirations
- [Specter Ops / nemesis](https://github.com/specterops/nemesis) - a tool to extract metadata from files
- [MythicAgents / nemesis](https://github.com/MythicAgents/nemesis) - Nemesis is an offensive data enrichment pipeline and operator support system. Built on Kubernetes with scale in mind, our goal with Nemesis was to create a centralized data processing platform that ingests data produced during offensive security assessments. Nemesis aims to automate a number of repetitive tasks operators encounter on engagements, empower operatorsâ€™ analytic capabilities and collective knowledge, and create structured and unstructured data stores of as much operational data as possible to help guide future research and facilitate offensive data analysis.
- [MythicAgents/ghostwriter](https://github.com/MythicAgents/Ghostwriter)

- [Ghost Manager / ghostwriter](https://github.com/GhostManager/ghostwriter) - a tool to extract metadata from files
Ghostwriter is a Django-based web application designed to be used by an individual or a team of red team operators. The platform tracks and manages client and project information, covert infrastructure assets (e.g., servers and domain names), finding templates, report templates, evidence files, and more.
