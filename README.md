## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. About / Motivations
This project is a work in progress.

I do not update the `README` as often as I should. But I do a better job of keeping the 
- [k8sploit-framework Wiki](https://github.com/OTRLabs/k8sploit-framework/wiki): Documentation for *deployment Guide* & *general user manual* & *developing* on the `k8sploit-framework`.
- [k8sploit-framework macro view project](https://github.com/orgs/OTRLabs/projects/6): An overview of all the `project` `issues`. 

The goal is to create a framework that allows for the easy creation of offensive security environments in a Kubernetes cluster. The framework will provide a set of tools and configurations that can be used to quickly set up and tear down offensive security environments for various purposes.
