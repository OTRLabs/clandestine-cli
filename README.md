## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. About / Motivations
This project is a work in progress.

I do not update the `README` as often as I should. But I do a better job of keeping the 
- [clandestine-framework Wiki](https://github.com/OTRLabs/clandestine-framework/wiki): Documentation for *deployment Guide* & *general user manual* & *developing* on the `clandestine-framework`.
- [clandestine-framework macro view project](https://github.com/orgs/OTRLabs/projects/6): An overview of all the `project` `issues`. 

### 1.2. Features

> "Aims to be somewhere in between [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) & [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) (or your favorite distro. As Long as it is Linux)."
